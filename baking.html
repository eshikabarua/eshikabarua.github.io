    <p>Baking is a good hobby and life skill as it is very entertaining and engaging. It allows you to be creative in a different way than arts and crafts and allows you to express yourself in your own unique way. It's an activity that can take as long or short as you'd like based on how hard your dish is. Baking is also very rewarding as you gain a sense of
      accomplishment once you finish, you have just spent hours in the kitchen creating your dish and will be proud once you are done. The best part of baking is being able to enjoy what you made and share it with others so they can also enjoy your sweet treats. If you are going to share your yummy creations with others it’s important to make sure no one is allergic to the ingredients you used. You never know what could happen if someone is allergic to the yummy treats you made and it’s better to be safe then sorry. </p>
