<h2>why?</h2>

<p>Crocheting is a fun and entertaining hobby which requires creative thinking and focus. It's easy to mess up the first few times but it's very important to keep a positive mind set and to persevere. After you practice crocheting for a while you will end up with a final product that you made with your hands and that is the best reward. You can crochet anything you want from blankets to animals to stuffed animals. You can make anything you want whenever you want. You can learn how to crochet by someone teaching you or by learning online. There are a ton of different videos online you can learn from to make many new things. There are also a ton of different patterns you can learn to make for blankets and tops. Once you learn the basics of crocheting you can make anything, you might need a video for learning new things but that makes it more fun. </p>
